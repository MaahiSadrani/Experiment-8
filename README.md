# Experiment-8
# Aim: Study of for loops in Python
# Theory:
The for loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times.
It is mainly used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range.
Unlike the while loop, the for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known.
The syntax of the for loop starts with the keyword for followed by a variable name and the keyword in.
The loop variable takes each value from the sequence one by one.
A colon (:) is used to begin the block of statements inside the loop.
Proper indentation is required to define the body of the loop.
The range() function is commonly used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers.
The range() function can take one, two, or three arguments (start, stop, step).
For loops can iterate through characters in a string.
They can also iterate through elements in a list or tuple.
Nested for loops can be used to solve pattern and matrix problems.
The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately.
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
Python also supports an optional else block with a for loop.
The else block executes when the loop completes normally without a break.
For loops help reduce code repetition and improve readability.
They are widely used in searching, sorting, and counting operations.
For loops are efficient and easy to use in Python programming.
Thus, the for loop is an important control structure in Python.
